	--1. Build a text file parser, which reads the grammar rules from a text file and identifies non-terminals, terminals and production rules and stores 
	     them. (done)
	--2. A function which will identify and remove left recursion if possible (done)
	--3. A function which will identify and remove left factoring if possible 
	--4. A function which computes first(X) (done) (still doesn't work for some cases)
	--5. A function which computes follow(X) (done) (still doesn't work for some cases)
	--6. A function which computes the parsing table (done)
